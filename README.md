# Data Collection 

The files in this repository are .ipynb files that can be opened with jupyter notebook. The jupyter notebook include the different processed data I worked with during my data collection internship. Note that the files used are not available in this git repository. However, it includes the code used to analyze the model output and the resulting plots.
